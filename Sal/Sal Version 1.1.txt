Sal
Version 1.1.0.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Purpose:
	I was working with creating multiple files across multiple computers. Things started to get confusing when I
was tranferring too many files to keep track on which file was where. I realized there was a pythonic way to do all this.
So I started developing Sal. Sal is a dropbox-like file merge system but instead of autosyncing,  he just collects files from
both of my drops, which is where I drop important files yet to be sorted, and moves them in a central location.

Update Notes
1.0.0
	Stable. Running as should. Sal is rudimentary in design. Semi-automated file mover.
1.1.0
	Added the __name__ function for importing, added text and py file merging to appropriate folders within destination.
